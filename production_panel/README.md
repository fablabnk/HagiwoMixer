# Faceplate Design for Eurorack Module  

## Overview  
This faceplate is designed for a **6HP Eurorack module**, following Doepfer standards for dimensions and mounting. It is intended for **laser cutting and engraving**, with specific stroke widths and colors for different operations.  

## Dimensions  
- **Front Panel Template:** 30.48mm x 128.5mm  
- **Actual Size:** 30.00mm x 128.5mm (adjusted for manufacturing tolerances)  
- **Mounting Holes:** 3.2mm x 5.2mm oval (positioned per Doepfer standard)  

## Laser Cutting and Engraving Guidelines  
- **Cutting Lines:** **Red (0.01mm stroke width)** – This defines the outer shape and cutouts for the panel.  
- **Engraving Lines:** **Black** – Used for text, logos, and markings to be engraved onto the surface.  

## Material Considerations  
- Use **thinner materials** to ensure components fit correctly.  
- Consider **material flexibility and durability** for a balance between rigidity and ease of installation.
